### Resolvers

"A _resolver_ is a set of instructions, expressed as a Python class. A _gateway_ will execute a resolver to fetch
content from various sources." - @aphelionz

Resolvers implement the logic necessary for fetch, preprocessing, cleaning and schematization of data from any available
resource. Based on the following class abstraction we can see the methods required for the development of a resolver:


~~~~
Define your resolvers modules below.
Ex: Each resolver must implement 2 fundamental methods.

class Dummy:
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return 'Test'

    def __call__(self, scheme, *args, **kwargs):
       """
        Returned meta should be valid scheme
        Process your data and populate scheme struct
        src/core/scheme/definition.py
        
        :param scheme: MovieScheme object
        :returns: Scheme valid object list ex: {movie1, movie2}
        :rtype Generator[MovieScheme]
        """
        yield data
